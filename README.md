## Overview

Music theory serves as the foundation for understanding music composition, performance, and analysis. This repository aims to explore various aspects of music theory through programming. By using algorithms, we can analyze chord progressions, scales, and other musical elements. The project is designed to help both musicians and programmers appreciate the intricacies of music.

## Features

- **Chord Progression Analysis**: Understand how different chords work together.
- **Circle of Fifths**: Visualize relationships between keys.
- **Optimized Algorithms**: Use time and space complexity-optimized algorithms for music analysis.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Explore how machine learning can enhance music theory applications.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Create a user-friendly interface for interaction.
